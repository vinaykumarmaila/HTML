    <p><b><u>The Pursuit of Happyness</u></b> is a 2006 American biographical drama film directed by Gabriele Muccino and starring Will Smith as Chris Gardner,<span style="background-color: rgb(54, 42, 165);" > a homeless salesman</span>. Smith's son Jaden Smith co-stars, making his film debut as Gardner's son, Christopher Jr. The screenplay by Steven Conrad is based on the best-selling 2006 memoir of the same name written by Gardner with Quincy Troupe. It is based on Gardner's nearly one-year struggle being homeless.[2] The unusual spelling of the film's title comes from a mural that Gardner sees on the wall outside the daycare facility his son attended. The movie is set in San Francisco in 1981</p>
